I've built a custom Literature Review database on [Zoho Creator](https://www.zoho.com/creator/) that contains 195 papers. Â I manage the PDFs and my notes in this GitHub repository.

This work has been the source of a number of refinements, good research questions and different ways to approach my research.

I've categorized the papers into the directories you see above.
